# Face Assignment

## Overview
This project was made as part of the Full Stack Development Internship hiring by Focus Academy for Career Enhancement. It is built in JavaScript and React and consists of a login page and a contacts list (home) page.

## Features

1. The application allows for access to homepage only after a login. No backend code has been added to allow logins so for the time being the only registered username is "foo" whose password is "bar".

2. Once logged in, the user can access the homepage which consists of a list of contacts as cards with each contact being given by their image, name, gender, age, cell and telephone numbers, location and email ID.

3. Full webapp is responsive and built using MaterialUI and React.

4. The contact list is retrieved from the randomuser.me API, five hundred (500) records are fetched at once and displayed, further records could not be retrieved at present.

5. The list is initially loaded with only ten (10) entries, but as the user scrolls down, they can encounter a button which they can click to load more results.

6. Logout button is only visible to the user once logged in and similarly the Load More button disappears after all possible entries have been displayed.

7. A loader is added and shows up before the initial results load on the home page.

8. The Load More button displays results with a one (1) second delay and at that time that button remains disabled.

9. A footer added at the end to attribute the creator of the webapp.

10. A login page shows a message at the bottom of the screen when wrong credentials are given, clicking on this makes it collapse.
